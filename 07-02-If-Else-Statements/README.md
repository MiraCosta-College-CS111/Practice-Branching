In this exercise, we'll be using an if-else statement to navigate decisions performed by the computer. 

In the method called isIntNegative, we will create a if-else statement that will tell the user whether or not a number is negative. 

Pro-tip: Name your methods like answering a question. 

To start, create an if-else statement with a condition that checks if num is less than zero.

If the condition is true, use the print statement below.
```
System.out.println(num + " is negative!");
```
If the condition is false, use this print statement below.
```
System.out.println(num + " is positive!");
```
