In all if statements, relational operators are used to compare values and form boolean expressions. This means we use symbols like greater-than, less-than, or equal-to to compare numbers, which result in a true or false conclusion. 

In this exercise, we will use if-then statements to direct our program in making the right decision about a traffic light. 

The variable we will be using in our expression has been declared and initialized. It is a char variable named lightColor initialized to the value 'g' , for green light.

In the checkLightColor(char color) method, create two more if-then statements to check if the lightColor is equivalent to 'g' or 'r' . If the char is 'g' , print "Put that pedal to the metal!". If the char is 'r' print "Stop!".
Remember that = = checks equivalence and = just assigns variables to values.

The syntax for a if-then statement is given below:
```
if (put your expression here) {
    // statements
    //Only runs the code in these curly braces if the expression is true
}
```
